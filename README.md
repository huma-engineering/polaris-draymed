# Announcement :loudspeaker: 

This repository is transferred from [gdm-SynseneHealth](https://github.com/sensynehealth/polaris-draymed) to Huma organisation as part of change in asset ownership 
# draymed
This repository contains JavaScript and Python libraries for providing providing SNOMED (and custom) codes for Polaris
applications.

## Maintainers
The Polaris platform was created by Sensyne Health Ltd., and has now been made open-source. As a result, some of the
instructions, setup and configuration will no longer be relevant to third party contributors. For example, some of
the libraries used may not be publicly available, or docker images may not be accessible externally. In addition, 
CICD pipelines may no longer function.

For now, Sensyne Health Ltd. and its employees are the maintainers of this repository.

## JavaScript library
For documentation of the JavaScript `draymed` library, see [draymed_js/README.md](draymed_js/README.md)

## Python library
For documentation of the Python `draymed` library, see [draymed_py/README.md](draymed_py/README.md)

copy the codes to the respective JavaScript and Python libraries.
